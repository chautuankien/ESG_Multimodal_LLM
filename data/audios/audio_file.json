    "transcription": " It's your money, why not invest it in something that's truly rooted in your values? Hey there, welcome back to my channel. It's another day of interviewing John Mollett, my colleague here at Pleasant Wealth. Thanks for being here again, John. Thanks, Liz. My pleasure. It's great to be able to have some of these conversations about what we talk about here in the office, here for you, so you can make some good decisions with your investments. So in today's video, we're going to be talking about ESG investing, and you may not have heard that term, but stay tuned because that's what we're going to talk about. Before we get into that, don't forget to subscribe to this channel for regular, pleasant financial content. All right, John, let's talk about ESG investing. What does ESG even stand for? So ESG stands for environmental social governance. Environmental is pretty self-explanatory, anything to do with being a good steward of the environment, natural resources, sustainability, and social has to do with social causes, money, the impact of money in places where maybe it's hard to come by capital for certain groups or minorities, things like that, social causes, the impact there. And then governance has to do with corporate behavior and equal opportunity and the way they treat their employees, things like that. As I've seen ESG, ESG investing has become more and more popular over the years. It's been the dog of the past for people who wanted to invest with their conscience because it was so expensive and they wouldn't get the right returns. So why would somebody want to invest ESG? First, for the impact of their dollars being invested in working in causes for good. So that, for example, in lending, if certain areas, geographically speaking, or people groups, ethnically or otherwise, have a hard time accessing capital and you can find a way to successfully lend in those areas to promote business and growth and those kind of things, that is a very positive impact in a way of helping others through business and investing. I noticed within my generation, there's such a negative thought about capitalism. But the fact is that capitalism can be used for good. So just through like what John is saying about providing lending opportunities in areas that don't have access to capital or to ethnic groups or certain groups of society that don't have the same opportunities as others, ESG investing is like the good side of capitalism. Agree? Yes, absolutely. So let's go back, John. I did say something about expenses and how the old baggage of ESG investing is that it's just too expensive and it takes away from their terms. How has that changed in the last 10 years? There seems to be an increase in new methodology in the screening and the way companies or investment companies are finding companies to invest in or projects or whatever it may be. And some of the new methodologies include rather than just defensive screening saying I won't invest in tobacco or alcohol or weapons or whatever it might be and whatever cause you believe in, it's out there. But with that, there's a more proactive choosing to invest in excellence. And because of that, yes, it's often still a little more expensive. But with that, I feel like there's a true opportunity for differentiation, like how a company treats its employees, how it relates to its local community, how it treats the supply chain and their customers and so on. Yeah. I mean, even in this year, a year of COVID, where our world was thrown upside down, any company that is willing to pay attention to how well they're treating their employees, how well they're treating their suppliers, are going to fare better in that type of environment because they have created the relationships and the sustainability in the process that they're not going to have the same upheaval as a company that doesn't pay attention to that. And so from that perspective here at Pleasant Wealth, we love ESG investing. If that's something that matters to you, we want to find options for you with that. Companies, corporate America or international, that are meeting these standards of ESG, environmental standards, social standards and governance, that they are more nimble long-term and there will be good growth from them long-term. Good corporate behavior towards their employees leads to more loyalty and and longer tenured employees, less turnover. That leads to more efficiency in how a company operates and money speaks. If behavior is going to kind of follow the money in a way, in a sense, because if money is going elsewhere because of a company's bad behavior, it can influence that company to change their behavior. Yeah. And we love companies changing their own behaviors to becoming better stewards of this fine world that we live in. Absolutely. All right. Thanks for joining us today, John, for the conversation about ESG investing. It's been a pleasure to have you here on my channel, Pleasant Financial Conversations. And for you, if you are approaching retirement and wanting to make sure that your investments are meeting the values and standards that you have as you approach the world, reach out to us. We'd love to help you find some solutions for your investments. You can find us at www.pleasantwealth.com to start that conversation. So until next time, friends, you take care."

    "transcription": " ESG, real or marketing? It's a complete fraud. Complete fraud. It's so ridiculous. Governance has been addressed, that's useful, but this idea that you're gonna get a stamp that says, oh listen, my supplier, I've offset their carbon credits and now I understand my imp, it's a joke, it's jargon. And I think what people are doing right now is using it as a way to, for example, if you can paint yourself as ESG, in Europe you can essentially borrow money from the ECB at negative rates. I'm gonna come over and give you a massage. It's a carry trade. He doesn't want you touching him, coronavirus. Go Chamath, go Chamath. Just a minute. Hold on, but I personally believe in climate change. I know. I think we need to do something, and so the problem with ESG is it's gonna take years for this, for this like, slot. But when you hear JP Morgan yesterday say they're not gonna finance fossil fuels, or you hear Ed Bastien at Delta say he's gonna spend $100 million, real money by the way, effectively buying carbon offsets and investing in new biofuels every year, you say. Two things. JP Morgan, by saying what they said, will be able to borrow billions of dollars from the ECB at negative rates. You think that's what that is? It's obviously what it is. It doesn't have to work. They don't need to do anything. They are now getting free money from Europe for basically being able to say this. And you don't think they would get that money otherwise? No, because Europe basically has this condition where you can issue green bonds, and you have all of this, you know, checks and balances. So that's one thing. It's going to be very important for you to really be able to diligence the supply chain all the way down to the supplier and the supplier supplier. So when you saw Microsoft to say they're gonna do, for example. These are useful statements. It's great marketing. But again, it's a lot of sizzle, no stake. I think that what we need to do is invest in actual companies that can go and count and can go and, you know, legitimize the actual impact that companies have so that you can do the right amount of carbon offsets. And then you have to have a legitimate exchange where you can actually trade them. So if you really believe in climate change, you gotta do some hard work now. Okay, by the way, Virgin Galactic is gonna be throwing an awful lot of carbon. Do you buy offsets? Galactica. Galactica. Yeah, we have a plan to sort of get to sustainability. You do, why? If it's all- Because it's important. He believes it. He just said he believes it. Thank you."
